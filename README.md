# Portfolio v1
Personal portfolio containing information needed for potential employers. Features about me section, language proficiency, projects, and contact. 

## Description
This is version 1 of my developer portfolio in which I lay the foundation of what I would like to one day soon present to future employers. This website advocates my personal work, style, and skills as a developer through the power of a minimalist approach and its ability to get "straight to the point." The page feautes everything I would desire for my future employer to know: who I am, the best work I have done, my resume, and how to get in contact with me. I am eager to continue adding onto this site as the months go by and as my knowledge grows more and more as a developer. I soon hope to become a full stack developer ready to take on the challenge of helping businesses and clients acheive their goals and aspirations through the development of modern, functional, and accesible, state-of-the-art software and applications.
