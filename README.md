# Portfolio v1
Personal portfolio containing information needed for potential employers. Features about me section, language proficiency, projects, and contact. 

## Description
I have been tasked by a marketing company to access their website code and refactor it, improving its accessibility. 

A few things that were revised as per instructions:
- "Cleaned up" code in both html and css files
    - Includes organization and simplifying of css selectors
- HTML code revised to be more semantic for better search engine optimization
- HTML headings attributes put in sequential order
- All images in html code were given an alt attribute
- Nav bar includes three links with its own designation on main section of webpage. However, one link was fixed since it    was not working at first ("S.E.O"). Issue has been submitted, fixed, and closed
- A title was added to the html head section so that viewers can see the name of the company on webpage tab

## Installation

## Usage 
When you open this website, a landing page appears.
The only functional parts of this website are the three links in the headers nav bar.
You may click on any and it will direct you to its corresponding section in the main section of the body. Each link is an important factor of the business and helps readers understand what Horiseon offers as a business to its clients.
